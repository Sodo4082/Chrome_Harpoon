4. Click on **Load unpacked** and select the downloaded folder.

### Usage

1. Use **Shift+Alt+H** to mark a tab (adds it to a list).

### Features

### Possible Improvements

1. Better persistence of tabs in the list; sometimes earlier tabs are overwritten.
2. Implement for more than 3 tabs (chrome extensions restrict to only 4 hotkeys)
3. Make a tutorial video.
4. No dependence of list shape on the first tab added.
5. Consistent spacing between buttons.
