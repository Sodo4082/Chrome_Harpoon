### Installation

1. Download the repository.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
4. Click on **Load unpacked** and select the downloaded folder.

### Usage

1. Use **Shift+Alt+H** to mark a tab (adds it to a list).
2. Jump to the first, second, or third entry in the list using **Shift+Alt+1**, **Shift+Alt+2**, and **Shift+Alt+3** respectively

---

### Features

- **Light and Dark modes**
- Can change the order of tabs or delete them from the list

### Possible Improvements

1. Better persistence of tabs in the list; sometimes earlier tabs are overwritten.
2. Implement for more than 3 tabs (chrome extensions restrict to only 4 hotkeys)
3. Make a tutorial video.
4. No dependence of list shape on the first tab added.
5. Consistent spacing between buttons.
